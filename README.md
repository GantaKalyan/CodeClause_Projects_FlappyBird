# Flappy Bird Game

This is a golden project developed during my internship program at Code Clause. It is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Python and the Pygame library. The game allows the player to control a bird's flight by pressing the spacebar or the up arrow key to avoid pipes and score points.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the game using the following command:

```bash
python flappy.py
```

5. The game will start, and you'll see the starting screen with the message "Press Space or Up Arrow to Start."
6. Press the spacebar or the up arrow key to make the bird flap its wings and begin the game.
7. Keep tapping the spacebar or the up arrow key to make the bird fly and avoid the pipes.
8. Score points by passing through the gaps between the pipes.
9. The game ends when the bird collides with the ground or a pipe.
10. When the game is over, the "Game Over" screen will display your final score and the message "Press any key to try again."
11. You can restart the game by pressing any key after the "Game Over" screen appears.

## Controls

- Press the spacebar or the up arrow key to make the bird flap its wings and fly.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Game Assets

The game uses the following assets from the "assets" directory:

- Bird sprites: `bluebird-upflap.png`, `bluebird-midflap.png`, `bluebird-downflap.png`
- Pipe sprite: `pipe-green.png`
- Background: `background-day.png`
- Ground: `base.png`
